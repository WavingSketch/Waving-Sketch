## Datasets used in join-aggregate estimation

In this application, we use two datasets: a real-world IP trace dataset CAIDA 2018, and a synthetic Zipf dataset. 
We provide some small shards of the two datasets to run our codes, and we provide the C++ codes to generate our Zipf datasets. More details can be foudn in the folders.
