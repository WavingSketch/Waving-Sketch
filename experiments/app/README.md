# WavingSketch on Six applications

## Overview

This folder contains the codes of WavingSketch and the related algorithms on six applications: finding top-k heavy changes, 
finding top-k persistent items, finding top-k Super-Spreaders, finding global top-k, subset query, and join-aggregate estimation. 


## File description

- `./topk_app`: codes of WavingSketch on three top-k applications

- `./join-aggregate`: codes of WavingSketch on the application of join-aggregate estimation. 
- `./global-TopK`: codes of WavingSketch on the application of finding global top-k.
- `./subset-sum`: codes of WavingSketch on the application of subset query.
